# Linear Data Structures Toolkit (C++)

A menu-driven C++ console application that demonstrates the implementation of
core linear data structures using array-based techniques.

---

##  Features
- Stack operations: push, pop, display
- Queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, display
- Menu-driven interface for easy interaction

---

## Concepts Used
- Arrays
- Stack and Queue implementation
- Functions and modular programming
- Switch-case control flow
- Overflow and underflow handling

---

## Purpose
This project was developed to strengthen fundamentals of Data Structures and
Algorithms by implementing basic linear data structures in a clear and
practical way.
